# Langcros
C/C++ microlanguage macros - made for fun, not for serious use

## What are langcros?
C/C++ macro languages, basically, are terrible "programming languages" that I make for fun to experiment with different syntaxes and ideas for gits and shiggles. I make these while bored to see how far I can take stupid syntax ideas
